Copy arn for policy you want to update by aws ui in IAM -> Policies -> <policy name> example arn value arn:aws:iam::508293016219:policy/AdministratorAccess-201910121620
For that policy in UI go to plicy version and click on edit to view policy json file, copy it
Save json file locally with file name NewPolicyVersion.json
Run below command with policy-arn from step1 and json file from step 3 aws iam create-policy-version     --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::508293016219:policy/AdministratorAccess-201910121620    --policy-document file://NewPolicyVersion.json --set-as-default
If any suntax error then run above command will show prompt saying syntax error, revisit json file in that case, otheriwse you will get applied json file output
Go to policy UI in aws and see under policy version new version set as default with applied changes
